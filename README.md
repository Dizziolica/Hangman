<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<p align="center">Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! In this game, you'll try to guess a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. You have a certain number of attempts, and if you run out of attempts before guessing the word, you lose.
How to Play

    Start the game by running the hangman.py script.
    The game will randomly select a word from a list of words and display a series of underscores, one for each letter in the word.
    You will be prompted to enter a letter. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the underscores. If it's not, you'll lose one of your attempts.
    Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
    If you guess the word, you win! If you run out of attempts, you lose.

Customizing the Game

You can customize the game by modifying the following variables in the hangman.py script:

    word_list: a list of words to choose from.
    max_attempts: the maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is lost.

Tips and Tricks

    Try to start with the most common letters in the English language, such as 'e' and 's'.
    If you're stuck, try thinking about the context of the word. For example, if the word is related to a specific topic, you might be able to narrow down your guesses based on that information.
    Don't be afraid to take a guess, even if you're not completely sure. Every guess brings you one step closer to either winning or losing.

Have Fun!

We hope you have a great time playing Hangman! If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to let us know. Happy guessing!
